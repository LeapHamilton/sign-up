A simple sign-up form


As I continue to work through the Odin Project, this is a simple client-side verified sign-up form, using only HTML and CSS. 
The biggest challenge in terms of layout was getting one section to overlap another; the logo over the extended background photo of an astronaut. I used CSS Grid for the whole page layout and took advantage of the span rows feature to get the background occupying the whole left side. I then positioned the overlapping section using Position:Absolute for the logo with the parent container being position:relative.

This project also marks a few other personal firsts; I had to use an external font (I chose Michroma) and an icon -- both of which I sourced from Google fonts. Moreover, this was the first time I used Regular Expressions, which are ironically named because they are anything but regular. 
Nevertheless I was able to design some expressions myself, though the password and international phone sections I admit to googling! 
I was surprised at the amount of stuff going on with the "form" section - each input needed various attributes, IDs, names etc and it was cool trying to think how to make the form easier to navigate, in terms of "required" fields etc. 
All in all, an enjoyable little project which, while not actual programming, gave me an insight into just how powerful the combination of HTML and CSS can be.
